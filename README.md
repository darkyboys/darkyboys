## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is darkyboi, A Computer Expert and a person who loves **low-level** and **mid-level** programming and even developed a **Custom Programming Language** just for learning by self and fun, I have also created **Virtual File-System** and a lot of the exeicing projects which now i want to contribute to the **Open-Source** community for free and as a source of learning for others.

I also have learnt a lot of programming languages such as : **C/C++**, **JavaScript**, **GDScript**, **GDShader**, **GLSL**, **Python**, **Ruby** and even more which now i can't remember, And from these i mostly codes in **C++** with some parts in **C** because these languages are my favourite and allows me to write almost everything i want from a **Simple-Console-Application** to a **Complex-GUI-Based** Programs. For Speedy development i also uses **AI** in some areas like for writting simple scripts for saving a lot of development time.

**Now i will seperate information about me in different sections through headings**

## Hobby & Intrests
My hobby is **low** to **mid-level** programming and i am really intrested to find an oppourtunity for **Collaboration** with other developers , Specifically to the **Open-Source** Community & **Linux Community**.

## Goals
My Main goal is to provide **free** & **Open-Source** + **Completly Private** programs for others to use and get value, I Want to eliminate the need of **paid** softwares and not private softwares for everyone, And as an **Arch Linux** user i want to make Linux Community a giant community or at-the-least a community where security & freedom is much more respected. Also i wants to educate innocent peoples about , Malwares and Silent Attacks and how different things in computer system works together.

## Currently Working For ?
I am currently working as an **independent-developer** who knows how Computers and Programming languages works at the most fundamental level and a short history for this is that i just wanted to make games like free-fire which i was not allowed to play in my home by my parents so i was curious about how things works together and this curosity drove me to this place where a kid having fear of creating a folder in windows now uses **Arch Linux** for getting maximum control over his system and i just want to give people things i didn't got for free and i have learnt everything from computer programming and how things wotrks together by-self, I didn't took any courses or institutions for learning just my curosity drove me to this point of skills and side-by-side i am also a youtuber with having experience of youtube of over 3 years.
