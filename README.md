I also have learnt a lot of programming languages such as : **C/C++**, **JavaScript**, **GDScript**, **GDShader**, **GLSL**, **Python**, **Ruby** and even more which now i can't remember, And from these i mostly codes in **C++** with some parts in **C** because these languages are my favourite and allows me to write almost everything i want from a **Simple-Console-Application** to a **Complex-GUI-Based** Programs. For Speedy development i also uses **AI** in some areas like for writting simple scripts for saving a lot of development time.

**Now i will seperate information about me in different sections through headings**
